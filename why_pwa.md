## Why is XPlot a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

XPlot is a PWA because it is easier to install, runs on multiple platforms and is easier to maintain and develop.

### Pros
1. Easy access - the user just goes to the app web site (https://xplot.app) and runs the app.
2. Easy to install - the app is directly installable on the user device (no app store is required).
3. Multi-platform - XPlot runs on Android phones, iPhone, iPad, tablets and desktop computers (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
4. Easy to maintain - no app store needed, developers just upload the latest version to the app website.
5. No backend - all user data is stored on the user device (this is true for XPlot).

### Cons
1. No app exposure in app stores - i.e. it may be harder for users to discover the app (1).
2. Native functionality sometimes not accessible - this doesn't apply to XPlot at the moment :-)

Given the above, I think it is fair to say that PWAs is the way to go!

*(1) PWAs can be published to app stores (e.g. Google Play and Windows Store). XPlot is actually published in Windows Store (https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NJNFZK6B15H).*
