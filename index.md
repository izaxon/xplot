### History
**Xplot** was initially created as hobby project with the following base requirements in mind.

1. Create a pure Javascript/HTML/CSS web app for plotting data.
2. Support plotting of time series data from CSV files.
3. Use **plotly** as the graph renderer (plotly is the only external dependency).
4. No backend or server required. All data is stored locally in your browser.
5. Make it an **Progressive Web App** (PWA, see https://pwabuilder.com for more info).

Since the start **Xplot** has grown in features, but still remain true to the intial requirements.

### How can I run/install XPlot?

XPlot is available and installable as a PWA (Progressive Web App) from this location: https://xplot.app.

XPlot runs in any modern web browser (tablets, mobile phones and the desktop). It can be installed on your PC or mobile/tablet. And it is also installable from the Windows Store on Windows PCs.
